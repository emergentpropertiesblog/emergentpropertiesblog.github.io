# Emergent properties

Welcome to our blog GitHub, which hosts all code used in our [blog website](https://emergentpropertiesblog.github.io)! The theme of this website was inspired by the (now defunct) [Tale theme](https://github.com/chesterhow/tale).

The website was created with a goal of readability on all devices and a focus on text content. An additional priority was for the blog to be *collaborative* -- for this we also built a rich system which allows for popups of attributable footnotes in main text. This allows other authors to comment and add perspectives to articles.

The website uses Jekyll. It was designed and deployed by [@rahulg603](https://github.com/rahulg603).
